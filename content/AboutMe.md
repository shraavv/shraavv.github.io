This is Shravya K Suresh, a first year CSE student in Amrita University!
I really like programming:computer: and explorimg new things.
My hobbies are reading:closed_book:, painting.
I also love listening to music:notes:!
I was born in Hyderabad and did my schooling until 10th there, after which i shifted to Trivandrum. 
I wasn't really interested in computer science before 10th grade:sweat_smile:. When I was first introduced to programming, it was then I started developing interest. 
I am also interested in the AI field, it has always left me curious with a lot if questions!
